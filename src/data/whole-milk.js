The package consists of up to 35% (by weight) of calcium carbonate and it provides strength and stiffness as well as whiteness to the package. After disposal the package can either be material recycled as plastics or recovered as energy by incineration. \n calcium carbonate filled polypropylene can generate a Green House Gas savings of approximately 23% - and this is before taking into consideration the increased productivity mentioned.',
